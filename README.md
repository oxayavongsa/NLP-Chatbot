## Project Overview
This project is part of the AAI-520: Natural Language Processing course in the **Applied Artificial Intelligence Program** at the University of San Diego under the guidance of **Professor Kahila Mokhtari, Ph.D.** Our goal is to design and implement a **generative-based chatbot** that not only engages in multi-turn conversations but also incorporates **sentiment analysis** to adapt its responses based on the emotional tone of user input.

The chatbot is trained using the **Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus**, enabling it to handle diverse conversations with coherence, context-awareness, and emotional sensitivity.

## Installation

To install and run the project on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oxayavongsa/NLP-Chatbot.git
   cd NLP-Chatbot
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv chatbot-env
   source chatbot-env/bin/activate

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the Chatbot:
* Open Chatbot.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Colab to run the chatbot interactively.
* Or, use the command line interface to interact with the chatbot.

## Dataset Information
* We used the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus which contains:

* 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters.
* 9,035 characters from 617 movies.
* In total, 304,713 utterances with metadata such as genres, release year, IMDB rating, and character gender.

## Methods Used
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Deep Learning using Transformer-based models
* Sentiment Analysis for emotionally aware responses

## Technologies
* Python for development.
* TensorFlow / PyTorch for model training.
* Hugging Face Transformers for leveraging pre-trained models like GPT.
* Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for experimentation and testing.

## How the Chatbot Works
The chatbot leverages a Transformer-based architecture to generate responses. It maintains multi-turn conversations, adjusts based on the context, and incorporates sentiment analysis to reflect the emotional tone of the user's input. It was trained on the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus, allowing it to mimic conversational flows and adapt to different styles of dialogues.

### Example Usage
(Replace the above link with an actual gif demo or video)

## Future Improvements
* Enhancing context retention over longer conversations.
* Fine-tuning the model for specific conversational tones or styles.
* Improving the user interface for web or mobile platforms.
